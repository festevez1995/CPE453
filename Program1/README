How is this LWP lib different from a real thread managment lib?
This LWP lib differes from a real thread managment lib because 
this implemented lib doesn't have synchronization tools
and also our LWP lib doesn't have any managment that can 
prevent deadlocking.
 
Name two ways in which this LWP lib API could be improved?
1. Add synchronization tools
2. Better schedualing algorithm to limit the amount of deadlocks
